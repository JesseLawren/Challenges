      Hey everyone! My name is Jesse and I just graduated with a BA in filmmaking with a specialty in Directing.  However I have been programming since I was a sophomore in highschool and even pursued a BS in AI before transferring to a film school in Chicago. A lot of my early adulthood has been spent traveling - 47 states and 9 countries.
    </p>
    <h2>I love</h2>
